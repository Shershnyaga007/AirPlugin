# AirPlugin

This plugin reworks the End world. Now in order to be there, you need to wear an oxygen tank to survive. Magnetite blocks serve as oxygen capsules of sorts.

It also adds new arrows that are capable of piercing your oxygen tank and causing an air leak.

```
To give an arrow with a specific oxygen consumption rate, use the command:
`/give Dynomaik minecraft:arrow{PublicBukkitValues:{"air:balloon_consumption_rate_booster":<rate>f}}`

Replace "<rate>" with the desired amount of oxygen consumed per second. For example, to give an arrow with a consumption rate of 20 oxygen per second, use:

`/give Dynomaik minecraft:arrow{PublicBukkitValues:{"air:balloon_consumption_rate_booster":20f}}`
```
